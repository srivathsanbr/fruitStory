🍏 Fruit Story — Where “Fresh” Also Means “Verified”

Fruit Story was created with one clear belief:
when it comes to what your family eats, “looks fresh” is not enough.

In most supply chains, fruits pass through multiple hands, multiple storage points, and multiple unknown conditions. That’s exactly where quality drops — and where safety becomes uncertain.

So we built Fruit Story differently:
✅ batch-wise screening
✅ clearance-first release
✅ strict handling + controlled storage
✅ traceability-focused ordering

And that’s how MEDIGRADE™ was born.

🔬 MEDIGRADE™ — Fruit Story’s Highest Safety Standard

Medigrade is our clinically screened, nutrient-retained, and lab-verified fruit category crafted for individuals with specific health and nutritional needs.

Each Medigrade batch undergoes stricter, clinical-grade testing and is released in limited weekly quantities only after laboratory clearance.
All fruits are tested in NABL-certified laboratories to ensure unmatched purity and safety.
Medigrade is available exclusively online to maintain strict quality control and traceability.

🍎 Our grade system (simple and transparent)

MEDIGRADE™  → Highest safety standard (clinical-level testing, limited weekly slots, online-only traceability)
Premium Grade → High quality with standard batch checks
Clean Grade   → Clean handling, basic assessment (offline preference)
